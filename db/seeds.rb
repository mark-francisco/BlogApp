# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Post.create(:title => "cat playing keyboard", :text => "cat is at it again")
# Post.create(:title => "dude jumps onto on-fire table", :text => "bills mafia at it again")
# Post.create(:title => "stand-up comedy show", :text => "comedian heckles heckler")

# Tag.create(:name => "funny")
# Tag.create(:name => "sports")

# PostTag.create(:post_id => 1, :tag_id => 1)
# PostTag.create(:post_id => 2, :tag_id => 1)
# PostTag.create(:post_id => 2, :tag_id => 2)
# PostTag.create(:post_id => 3, :tag_id => 1)
